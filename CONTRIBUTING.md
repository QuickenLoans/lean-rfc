# Contributing Guide

In addition to this guide, [GitHub Guides] has additional content on best
practices for [Contributing to Open Source on GitHub].


## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a [Code of Conduct] borrowed from the [Contributor
Covenant]; everyone is expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable
behavior to at least one of the people listed in the [Maintainers] list.


## Response Time

Maintainers should respond to all new comments, issues, and pull requests by
the next business day; even if that response is to say that it will be longer
before any meaningful feedback can be given. *Please allow for some leniency
during any holidays.*

It is important to offer transparency in what is happening with a proposed
change. Not all proposed changes will be accepted as not all changes will align
with the goal of the project.

If you propose changes and don't hear back after a day or two feel free to
comment again to hopefully ping us again to remind us to respond; we hope that
this does not become a normal event.


## Changes

Changes to this project should follow [Lean RFC] guidelines. Any questions
should be posed as [issues] and discussed there.


### Commit Messages

Commit messages should follow the [commit message format] (included in the root
directory of this repository). You can set this template as the default text
for any commit messages by using the following command:

```bash
$ git config --add commit.template ./commit.template
```

*This command will only set this template file as the default commit template
for this repository and will not affect any of your other repositories.*

Read more about the [Git Commit Templating] feature.
